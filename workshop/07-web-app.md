# 08 - Deploy the Chat Web App

## 1) Overview

The `webapp/` folder contains a standalone Flask chat interface for Biashara Bot. It connects to GitHub Models for the LLM and reuses the same JSON data files as the MCP server no separate server process needed. The idea here is to see your agent in action.

```
Browser → Flask (webapp/app.py) → GitHub Models API
                ↓
        mcp-server/data/*.json (menu + FAQs)
```

## 2) Install dependencies

Make sure your virtual environment is active, then install the web app requirements:

```bash
pip install -r webapp/requirements.txt
```

## 3) Set your GitHub Token

The web app uses GitHub Models as the LLM backend. You need a **GitHub personal access token (PAT)** to authenticate.

### Create a token

1. Go to [github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta) and click **Generate new token**.
2. Select **Fine-grained token** (recommended) or **Classic token**.
3. Give it a descriptive name, e.g. `biashara-bot-workshop`.
4. Set an expiration (7 days is fine for a workshop).
5. **Permissions required:** No additional scopes are needed — the default public access is sufficient for GitHub Models.
6. Click **Generate token** and copy the value immediately (you won't see it again).

### Export the token

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_your-token-here"
```

> **Tip:** You can also create a `webapp/.env` file with `GITHUB_TOKEN=your-token` — the app loads `.env` files automatically.

## 4) Start the web app

```bash
python webapp/app.py
```

You should see:

```
🍽️  Biashara Bot Web App starting...
   Model: gpt-4.1-mini
   Endpoint: https://models.github.ai/inference
   Open http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser
```

## 5) Chat with Biashara Bot

Open [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000) in your browser. Try these questions:

```text
I'm in a rush — what's a quick and affordable breakfast option?
```

```text
Niko Kilimani. Mnatuma huku na ni free delivery?
```

```text
We have a meeting tomorrow with 20 people — can you handle that on short notice?
```

## 6) How it works

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `webapp/app.py` | Flask backend with the system prompt, tool definitions, and an agentic tool-calling loop |
| `webapp/templates/index.html` | Chat UI with a green/purple Savanna Bites theme |
| `mcp-server/data/*.json` | Shared data files (menu + FAQs) — same as the MCP server |
| GitHub Models API | LLM inference via the OpenAI-compatible endpoint |

The app mirrors the two MCP tools (`search_business_faqs`, `get_product_catalogue`) as OpenAI function-calling tools. When the model decides it needs data, Flask executes the tool locally and feeds the result back — up to 5 rounds per message.

## 7) Configuration

You can customise the app with environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | *(required)* | Your GitHub personal access token |
| `MODEL` | `gpt-4.1-mini` | Model name to use |
| `ENDPOINT` | `https://models.github.ai/inference` | OpenAI-compatible API endpoint |
